# 🧑‍💻 Python Basics – Exercises

These exercises will help you practice **variables, loops, lists, functions, and conditionals**.  
Try solving them **before looking up solutions**!

---

## 🔹 Exercise 1 – User Input
Write a program that asks the user for their **name** and **age**,  
then prints a message:

👉 Example:
```

Enter your name: Alice
Enter your age: 25

```
Output:
```

Hello Alice, you are 25 years old!
In 5 years, you will be 30.

```

---

## 🔹 Exercise 2 – Even Numbers
Write a program that prints all **even numbers from 1 to 20**.  

👉 Extra Challenge:
- Print them on the **same line** separated by commas.  
- Count how many even numbers were printed.  

---

## 🔹 Exercise 3 – List Operations
Create a list of 5 numbers and print:
- ✅ The sum of all numbers  
- ✅ The largest number  
- ✅ The smallest number  
- ✅ The average of the numbers  

👉 Extra Challenge:
- Ask the user to **input the numbers** instead of hardcoding them.  

---

## 🔹 Exercise 4 – Palindrome Checker
Write a function `is_palindrome(word)` that checks if a word is a palindrome.  

👉 Examples:
- `is_palindrome("madam") → True`  
- `is_palindrome("hello") → False`  

👉 Extra Challenge:
- Ignore **capitalization** and **spaces**.  
  - `"RaceCar"` → True  
  - `"nurses run"` → True  

---

## 🔹 Exercise 5 – Multiplication Table
Ask the user for a number and print its multiplication table (from 1 to 10).  

👉 Example for `3`:
```

3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
...
3 x 10 = 30

```

---

## 🔹 Exercise 6 – Guess the Number (Mini Game 🎮)
- The program chooses a random number between 1 and 10.  
- The user has 3 chances to guess it.  
- Give hints if the guess is too high or too low.  

👉 Example:
```

Guess a number between 1 and 10: 5
Too low!
Guess again: 8
Too high!
Guess again: 7
🎉 Correct! You win!

```

---

## 🔹 Exercise 7 – Word Counter
Write a program that asks the user to enter a sentence and then:  
- Counts how many words it has  
- Counts how many characters it has (excluding spaces)  

👉 Example:
```

Enter a sentence: Python is awesome
Words: 3
Characters (no spaces): 14

```

---

## 🔹 Exercise 8 – FizzBuzz
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 50, but:  
- For multiples of 3, print `"Fizz"` instead of the number.  
- For multiples of 5, print `"Buzz"`.  
- For multiples of both 3 and 5, print `"FizzBuzz"`.  

👉 Example Output:
```

1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, ...

```

---

## 🔹 Exercise 9 – Reverse a String
Write a function that takes a string and returns it reversed.  

👉 Example:
- Input: `"Python"`  
- Output: `"nohtyP"`  

👉 Extra Challenge:
- Check if the reversed string is the same as the original (palindrome).  

---

## 🔹 Exercise 10 – Basic Calculator
Write a function that asks the user for two numbers and an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)  
and performs the calculation.  

👉 Example:
```

Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Choose operation (+, -, \*, /): \*
Result: 50

```

✅ These exercises cover:
- **Input/output**
- **Loops**
- **Lists**
- **Functions**
- **Conditionals**
- **String manipulations**
- **Mini-games**
